# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a simple Java-based application to manage books in a library.  
It demonstrates core OOP concepts such as **classes, objects, encapsulation**, and **design patterns (Builder Pattern)**.

## Features

- **Book Class**: Represents a book with details such as title, author, ISBN, and publication year.

- **Library Class**: Holds a collection of books and demonstrates aggregation.

- **Builder Pattern**: Used to build `Book` objects with optional and mandatory attributes.

- **Encapsulation**: All fields are private with getters and setters.
